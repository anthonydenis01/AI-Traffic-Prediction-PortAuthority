# 🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Prediction & Toll Enforcement  
**Port Authority of New York & New Jersey – Capstone Project | University of New Haven (2025)**  

### 📍 Overview  
Developed **machine learning models and dashboards** to forecast traffic volume, detect toll violations, and optimize operations across the Port Authority’s bridges and tunnels.  
This project integrates **predictive analytics, time-series forecasting, and real-time visualization** to improve congestion management, safety, and toll collection efficiency.

## 🎯 Goals & Key Models  
| Model Type | Purpose | Performance |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Classification (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)** | Identify toll violation risk by time and weather | ✅ Accuracy: 97.2% · AUC: 0.997 |
| **Regression (Azure AutoML)** | Predict EZPass traffic volume | ✅ R² = 0.99 |
| **Time Series (Prophet)** | Forecast seasonal and hourly traffic patterns | ✅ MAE = 833 · R² = 96.9% |

## 📊 Key Insights  
- ❄️ **Snow days reduce traffic volume by ~25%.**  
- 🚗 **GWB Lower Span** has the highest annual violations (~1.2M).  
- 🕐 **8 AM–4 PM** window accounts for **43% of total traffic volume.**  
- 💰 Implementing **ALPR systems** + dynamic fines could recover **$150M+ annually.**
